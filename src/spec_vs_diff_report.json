  "summary": "The diff shows changes in `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` adding a responsive, stacked-on-mobile layout for `ApprovedUserRow` using Tailwind classes (`flex flex-col sm:flex-row ...`), which aligns with REQ-1’s mobile-optimized alignment/spacing goal. Due to truncation, it’s not fully verifiable whether only the Approved Users section was changed and whether button labels/behavior remained identical, but no explicit behavior changes are visible in the provided excerpt.",
