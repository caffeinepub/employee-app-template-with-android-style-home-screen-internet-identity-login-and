        "Only the \"Approved Users\" section UI is changed; \"Pending Approvals\", reset section, and other pages remain visually/functionally unchanged.",
        "On small/mobile widths, each ApprovedUserRow no longer overflows horizontally and no buttons are clipped off-screen.",
        "On small/mobile widths, the ApprovedUserRow layout is stacked (content area and actions arranged to fit narrow screens) with consistent spacing and alignment (no overlapping elements).",
        "The action buttons in ApprovedUserRow (Make/Remove Admin and Remove) remain fully usable and trigger the same callbacks as before; no new confirmation flows or behavior changes are introduced.",
        "On tablet/desktop widths, the ApprovedUserRow retains an appropriate horizontal layout similar to the current design (no regression).",
        "Implementation is done by editing the ApprovedUserRow markup/classes in frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx (responsive Tailwind classes preferred)."

          "description": "Update only the ApprovedUserRow JSX structure and Tailwind classes to be responsive: use a stacked layout on small widths (e.g., flex-col with gaps, actions below content) and a horizontal layout on sm+; ensure the text/content region uses min-w-0 and truncation/wrapping to avoid horizontal overflow; ensure the actions container wraps or stacks and buttons use responsive widths (e.g., w-full on mobile, w-auto on larger screens). Keep callbacks, button labels, and disabled logic exactly the same, and do not alter other sections (Pending Approvals, Reset, Announcement)."
